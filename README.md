[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chapman-cs510-2016f/cw-09-YOURNAME.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chapman-cs510-2016f/cw-09-YOURNAME)

**Due date:** 2016/11/01

## Specification

**Note: Remember this is a C project.**

Complete the following exercises, saving your solutions in the indicated files. 

1. Read the following style guide carefully for C, and use it: [C Style Guide](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C_Programming/Structure_and_style)
1. Use the following references as needed in what follows. They will be useful throughout the rest of the course.
    * [Learn C in Y Minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/c/)
    * [C Cheat Sheet](https://www.cheatography.com/ashlyn-black/cheat-sheets/c-reference/)
    * [C Programming Wikibook](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C_Programming)
    * [Learn Make in Y Minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/make/)
1. Verify that running the command ```make test``` in a command line (from within your repository directory) compiles code and runs unit tests. Do the tests pass? Look through the code. In a Jupyter notebook ```C_Compilation.ipynb```:
    * Describe what the purpose of a Makefile is
    * Describe how the code is organized here. Why is this a reasonable structure?
    * Describe what a header file is.
    * Describe what a source file is.
    * Describe what an object file is.
    * Describe what compiling is.
    * Describe what linking is.
1. Look at the definitions for the C function ```int factorial(int n)```. In a Jupyter notebook ```Factorial.ipynb```:
    * Describe the algorithm being used.
    * Describe at least two problems with the current function definition.  
    * Describe how you can fix those problems.
1. Edit the file ```factorial.c``` (using ```vim```) to fix the two problems you identified. Make sure the tests now pass.
1. Edit the file ```test_factorial.c``` (using ```vim```) to add one more reasonable test for the factorial function. Make sure the new test passes. 
1. Push only the changes to the header or source files to GitHub, along with your Jupyter notebooks. You should never push binary programs, or object files, or logs.
1. Make sure that Travis passes correctly.
